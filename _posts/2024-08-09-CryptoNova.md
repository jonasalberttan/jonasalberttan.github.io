# Prerequisites
Make sure that you have Node >=14 (or any newer LTS Node.js version) and NPM v6+ or Yarn v1 (classic) or PNPM v8+ installed on your machine.

# Optional - Install the Global CLI
For doing more with Quasar, you should also install the global CLI. With it you can directly run Quasar commands in the terminal, run a local http server for testing or do upgrades on your project.

=== "Yarn"
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

=== "npm"
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

# Start the app in development mode.

```bash
yarn dev
```
