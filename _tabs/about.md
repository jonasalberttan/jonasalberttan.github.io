    I have a rich and diverse experience in software development, started my career with a Japanese company, and towards my journey with companies with different cultures gaining extensive experience in multi-platform development (desktop, web, mobile, and hardware integration). I worked in various domains (Manufacturing, Automation & Security, International Retail, Hospital, Outsourcing, Home Health Care, Diagnostic Center, and SaaS Insurance). My expertise spans multiple tech stacks, including .Net, C#, Laravel, Python, VueJs, iOS Swift, MSSQL, MySQL, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. I managed a team of two developers, guiding them through projects using Laravel, VueJs, MySQL, and AWS stacks. Additionally, I’ve developed valuable personal qualities that have been instrumental in my role as a project manager in previous experience. My experience also includes contributing to the development of Dr. Oz’s iOS application, which earned a nomination for a prestigious 2015 Emmy Award. The Employee of the Year award I received in 2007 is a testament to the quality of my work. I’m excited about the opportunity to connect and discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to your team. Let’s connect!

                <ul>
                    <li align="justify">During my short stint, my role involves automating data applications using Azure Data Factory to ingest, create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows in the cloud. Set up a storage account to seamlessly upload data in CSV or JSON format. Streamlining data management processes within the Azure environment. Set up a Data Lake Storage Gen2. That combines the capabilities of Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, providing a highly scalable and cost-effective solution for storing large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Imposed a meta-driven ingestion that allows a dynamic and flexible ingestion of data by leveraging metadata to define the structure, format, and location of the source data. This feature automates the process of ingesting data from various sources into Azure data stores, reducing manual effort and enabling faster data integration. By configuring metadata-driven ingestion, users can easily adapt to changes in data sources and schemas, ensuring efficient and reliable data ingestion pipelines. Created a utility pipeline to send email notifications for data pipeline monitoring, error handling, and scheduled job completion. Imposed an event-driven ingestion that facilitates the automatic ingestion of data based on predefined triggers or events. This approach eliminates the need for manual intervention, ensuring that data is promptly ingested into the system as soon as it becomes available, thereby enabling real-time data processing and analysis. Creation of a full cycle of a running pipeline (source and sink datasets, uploading of the source data, and executing triggers/events).</li>
