    I’ve been working in the software development industry for over 20 years, starting my career with a Japanese company and towards my journey with companies with different cultures gaining extensive experience in multi-platform development (desktop, web, mobile, and hardware integration). I worked in various domains (Manufacturing, Automation & Security, International Retail, Hospital, Outsourcing, Home Health Care, Diagnostic Center, and SaaS Insurance). My expertise spans multiple tech stacks, including .Net, C#, Laravel, Python, VueJs, iOS Swift, MSSQL, MySQL, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. I managed a team of two developers, guiding them through projects using Laravel, VueJs, MySQL, and AWS stacks. Additionally, I’ve developed valuable personal qualities that have been instrumental in my role as a project manager in previous experience. My experience also includes contributing to the development of Dr. Oz’s iOS application, which earned a nomination for a prestigious 2015 Emmy Award. The Employee of the Year award I received in 2007 is a testament to the quality of my work. I’m excited about the opportunity to connect and discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to your team. Let’s connect!
